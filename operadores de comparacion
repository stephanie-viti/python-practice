# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher

# the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True 
# result.

# The "today" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison
# "today == Tuesday" False. The logical operator "not" inverts the False
# result to become True. In other words, this expression asks if it is
# false that today is not Tuesday. More succinctly, "not False" means 
# True."
